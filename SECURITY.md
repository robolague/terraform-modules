# Security

This repository implements comprehensive security scanning and best practices for Terraform modules.

## Security Scanning

### tfsec Integration

We use [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) for automated security scanning of Terraform code. tfsec is a static analysis security scanner that identifies potential security issues in your Terraform configurations.

#### What tfsec Checks

- **AWS Security**: IAM policies, S3 bucket security, encryption settings
- **Azure Security**: Storage account security, network security groups
- **GCP Security**: IAM roles, storage bucket permissions
- **General Security**: Resource access controls, network security

#### Common Security Issues

1. **Encryption Issues**
   - Unencrypted storage buckets
   - Missing encryption at rest
   - Insecure transport protocols

2. **Access Control Issues**
   - Overly permissive IAM policies
   - Public resource access
   - Missing authentication

3. **Network Security Issues**
   - Open security groups
   - Insecure network configurations
   - Missing firewall rules

### Automated Scanning

Security scanning runs automatically on:

- **Pull Requests**: Every PR is scanned for security issues
- **Main Branch**: All pushes to main are scanned
- **Release Process**: Security checks before releases

### Configuration

Security scanning is configured via:

- `.tfsec.yml`: Custom rules and exclusions
- GitHub Actions: Automated scanning workflows
- SARIF Output: Results integrated with GitHub Security tab

## Security Best Practices

### Module Development

1. **Follow Security Standards**
   - Use least privilege principles
   - Implement proper encryption
   - Configure secure defaults

2. **Document Security Considerations**
   - Include security notes in README
   - Document required permissions
   - Explain security trade-offs

3. **Test Security Configurations**
   - Validate security group rules
   - Test IAM policy permissions
   - Verify encryption settings

### Common Security Patterns

#### AWS Security Groups
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name_prefix = "example-"
  
  # Explicitly deny all traffic by default
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  # Only allow specific traffic
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
  }
}
```

#### S3 Bucket Security
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}
```

## Handling Security Issues

### False Positives

If tfsec reports a false positive:

1. **Document the Issue**: Add a comment explaining why it's safe
2. **Use Exclusions**: Add to `.tfsec.yml` exclusions if appropriate
3. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review exclusions

### Security Exclusions

To exclude specific checks, add to `.tfsec.yml`:

```yaml
exclusions:
  - "AWS018"  # Security group rule descriptions
  - "AWS017"  # S3 bucket encryption
```

### Security Warnings

Some security issues may be warnings rather than errors:

```yaml
soft_fails:
  - "AWS018"  # Treat as warning
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue**
2. **Email**: [Add your security contact email]
3. **Include**: Detailed description and reproduction steps
4. **Response**: We'll respond within 48 hours

## Security Compliance

This repository aims to comply with:

- **AWS Well-Architected Framework**
- **Azure Security Center recommendations**
- **GCP Security Command Center**
- **Industry security standards**
